/*DOM - Document Object Model
Strucutred representation of an HTML document
Connect webpages to scripts
For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with. 
Javascript and DOM are different
Use methods (functions attached to some object) / functions in javascript that allows us to interact and manipulare the DOM and therefore the webpage
functions attached to some object - this is the object that gives access to the DOM
The html webpage content is stored in the DOM, which can then be accessed and manipulated by Javascript */
