//All JS codes run in an environment -> Execution Context (Piece of code is executed )-> Default - Global Execution Context (Code that is not inside any function)

// lastName === window.lastName
//Global execution context lies as the first one in the execution stack.
//On top of the global execution context, as many new execution context (function) lies on the gec - EXECUTION STACK
